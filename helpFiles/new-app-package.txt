          WARNING: The name must be unique. The new App
          Package will not be created if an App Package
          with the same name already exists at the path
          that corresponds to the path assigned to the
          `--path` flag.
          ~~~~~
  ~~~```[--domain]```~~~~~
          ~~~
          The default domain that the App this App Package
          makes will be built for.
          ~~~~~
          ~~~
          After an App Package is made into an App via
          `rig --make-app-package`, the App will not be
          usable until it is built for a domain.
          ~~~~~
          ~~~
          An App is built for a domain by executing the App's
          `Components.php` file via `php`.
          ~~~~~
          ~~~
          For example:
          ~~~~~
          ~~~
          ```
          php /path/to/roady/Apps/Foo/Components.php
          ```
          ~~~~~
          ~~~
          If a domain is not specified when the App's
          `Components.php` file is executed, then the App
          will be built for the default domain that is
          hard coded in the App's `Components.php` file.
          ~~~~~
          ~~~
          The `--domain` flag is used to set the value of the 
          default domain that will be hard coded in the 
          `Components.php` file that belongs to the App that 
          is made from this App Package.
          ~~~~~
          ~~~
          Note: If the `--domain` flag is not specified, the 
          domain `http://localhost:8080` will be set as the 
          default domain.
          ~~~~~
          ~~~
          Note: More information about building Apps, and
          the `Components.php` file, can be obtained via:
          ~~~
          ```
          rig --help Components.php
          ```
          ~~~~~
          ~~~~~
  ~~~```[--path]```~~~~~
          ~~~
          The path to create the App Package at. If not
          specified, the current working directory will be
          used.
          ~~~~~

  ### Examples:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --new-app-package \
      --name Foo

  rig --new-app-package \
