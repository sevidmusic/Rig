     [--static]

Description:

Configure output for a specified App to show up in response to specified Requests.
Note: If the specified App does not exist it will be created.

Flags:

--for-app             The name of the App to configure the output for.

--name                The name used to determine the names to assign to the
                      components that will be configured for the output.

                      WARNING: The specified --name MUST be unique. If any of the
                      names that would be assigned to the one of the Components
                      to be configured for the output would conflict with the
                      name of an existing Component then the output will not be
                      configured. This is to prevent existing Components from
                      being replaced by mistake.

--output              The output to assign. This flag is required unless the
                      --output-source-file flag is specified.

                      WARNING: This flag will be ignored if specified in
                      conjunction with the --output-source-file flag.

--output-source-file  The path to the file whose contents will be assigned as the
                      output. This flag is requried unless the --output flag is
                      specified.

                      WARNING: If both the --output and --output-source-file
                      flags are specified the --output-source-file's contents
                      will be assigned as the output, and the --output flag will
                      be ignored.

[--global]            If specifed, the output will served in response to all
                      Requests to any domain the App is built for. This causes
                      rig to configure a GlobalResponse to serve the output
                      instead of a Response.

[--output-position]   The position to assign to the DynamicOutputComponent or
                      OutputComponent that will be configured for the output.
                      This position will be used to sort the output relative to
                      other output that is being served by the same Response
                      or GlobalResponse.

[--relative-urls]     The relative urls the output should be served in response
                      to. Thes urls are defined relative to a domain.

                      For example, to configure the output to show up in response
                      to requests to the domain's root, the relative url '/'
                      could be specified.

                      Another example, to configure the output to be served in
                      response to a request named "Homepage" the relative url
                      '?request=Homepage' or 'index.php?request=Homepage' could
                      be defined.

[--response-position] The position to assign to the Response or GlobalResponse
                      that will be configured for the output. This position is
                      used to sort the Response or GlobalResponse configured for
                      the output relative to other Responses and GlobalResponses
                      that respond to the same Request.

[--static]            If specified, an OutputComponent will be configured for the
                      output instead of a DynamicOutputComponent.

                      This means the output will be defined in a OutputComponent
                      configuration file in the App's OutputComponents directory
                      instead of in a file in the App's DynamicOutput directory.

Examples:

rig --configure-app-output \
--for-app Foo \
--name Bar \
--output '<p>Hello Universe</p>' \
--relative-urls './' 'index.php' 'index.php?request=BarBaz' \
--static

rig --configure-app-output \
--for-app Foo \
--name Bar \
--output-source-file /path/to/output/source/file \
--global
