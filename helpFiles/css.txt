  # Css
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Css stylesheets must be provided by a roady App to be served
  by a website running on roady.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  An App's stylesheets must be located in the App's css directory.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Stylesheets can be served globally, or in response to specific
  requests.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If an App defines a stylesheet whose name contains the word `global`,
  then that stylesheet will be served in response to all requests to
  any domains the App is built for.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If an App defines a stylesheet whose name does not contain the word
  `global`, then the stylesheet will only be served in response to
  requests whose name matches the name of the stylesheet excluding
  the `.css` extension.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The name of the request will correspond to the value of
  `$_GET['request']`.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  # For example:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Create a HelloWorld App that provides a single stylesheet named
  `homepage.css`. `homepage.css` will only be served in response
  to requests with the name `homepage`. This will be any request
  that assigns the value `homepage` to `$_GET['request']`.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: In the following example roady is assumed to be installed
  at the path `~/roady`, if roady is installed somewhere else make
  sure to adjust the paths used in the example appropriately.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  1. Create a HelloWorld App that configures global output:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```rig --configure-app-output \
  --for-app HelloWorld \
  --name HelloWorld \
  --output '<p>Hello World</p>' \
  --global```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: `rig --configure-app-output` is used in this example to
  create the HelloWorld App and configure the appropriate Components.
  For more information about `rig --configure-app-output` use:

  `rig --help --configure-app-output`.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  2. Define styles for the HelloWorld App in a stylsheet named
  `homepage.css`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```printf '\n%s\n' 'p { background: black; color: white; }' \
  > ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/css/homepage.css```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  3. Build the HelloWorld App for the local domain http://localhost:8080:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'https://localhost:8080'```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  4. If one is not already running, start a development server on
  port `8080` so HelloWorld is available at the local domain
  `http://localhost:8080`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```rig --start-server --port 8080 --open-in-browser```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: If http://localhost:8080 does not open in a web browser
  automatically you will have to open it in a web browser manually.
  For more information about `rig --start-server` use
  `rig --help --start-server`.
