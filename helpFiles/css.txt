  # Css
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Css stylesheets must be provided by a roady App to be served
  by a website running on roady.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  An App's stylesheets must be located in the App's css directory.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Stylesheets can be served globally, or in response to specific
  requests.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If an App defines a stylesheet whose name contains the word `global`,
  then that stylesheet will be served in response to all requests to
  any domains the App is built for.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If an App defines a stylesheet whose name does not contain the word
  `global`, then the stylesheet will only be served in response to
  requests whose name matches the name of the stylesheet excluding
  the `.css` extension.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The name of the request will correspond to the value of
  `$_GET['request']`.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  # For example:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Create a HelloWorld App that provides a single stylesheet named
  `homepage.css`. `homepage.css` will only be served in response
  to requests with the name `homepage`. This will be any request
  that assigns the value `homepage` to `$_GET['request']`.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: In the following example roady is assumed to be installed
  at the path `~/roady`, if roady is installed somewhere else make
  sure to adjust the paths used in the example appropriately.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  1. Create a HelloWorld App that configures global output:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```rig --configure-app-output \
  --for-app HelloWorld \
  --name HelloWorld \
  --output '<p>Hello World</p>' \
  --global```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: `rig --configure-app-output` is used in this example to
  create the HelloWorld App and configure the appropriate Components.
  For more information about `rig --configure-app-output` use:

  `rig --help --configure-app-output`.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  2. Define styles for the HelloWorld App in a stylsheet named
  `homepage.css`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```printf '\n%s\n' 'p { background: black; color: white; }' \
  > ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/css/homepage.css```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  3. Build the HelloWorld App for the local domain http://localhost:8080:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'https://localhost:8080'```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  4. If one is not already running, start a development server on
  port `8080` so HelloWorld is available at the local domain
  `http://localhost:8080`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```rig --start-server --port 8080 --open-in-browser```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: If http://localhost:8080 does not open in a web browser
  automatically you will have to open it in a web browser manually.
  For more information about `rig --start-server` use
  `rig --help --start-server`.

  ~~~
  Note:
  ~~~
  Apps can define stylesheets that are served in response to
  specific Requests to the domains an App is built for, or can define
  stylesheets that are served in response to all Requests to the
  domains an App is built for.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If the name of a stylesheet defined by an App contains the word
  `global`, it will be served in response to all Requests to the
  domains that the App is built for.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For instance, in the Hello World example a stylesheet named
  `hw-global-styles.css` is defined by the HelloWorld App, and
  the HelloWorld App is built for the domain http://localhost:8080,
  so the `hw-global-styles.css` stylesheet will be served in response
  to all Requests to the domain http://localhost:8080.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If the stylesheet's name does not contain the word `global`, then the
  stylesheet will only be served in response to Requests whose name
  matches the name of the stylesheet, excluding the `.css` extension.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: The name of the Request will correspond to the value of
  `$_GET['request']`.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For instance, if the HelloWorld App also defined a stylesheet
  named `homepage.css`, then the `homepage.css` stylesheet would
  only be served in response to Requests that have the name
  `homepage`. For example:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080?request=homepage
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080/index.php?request=homepage
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080/index.php?foo=bar&request=homepage
