[--path-to-apps-directory]

This flag can be used in conjunction with other ddms flags to manually set the
Darling Data Management Apps directory path used by ddms to an alternative
Apps directory path.

Typically it is not necessary to specify this flag. ddms will attempt to locate
the Apps directory at the following path relative to ddms's root directory:

    ../../../Apps

If ddms cannot locate the expected Apps directory ddms will use the path to
ddms's tmp directory as the --path-to-apps-directory. ddms's tmp directory will
be located in ddms's root directory, for example:

/path/to/ddms/tmp

WARNING: Unless you really need to, it is best to let ddms manage the
--path-to-apps-directory flag's value to insure an appropriate path is used.

Examples:

ddms --new-app --name Foo --path-to-apps-directory ~/AlternativeAppsDirectory

ddms --new-request --name Foo --for-app Foo --path-to-apps-directory ~/AlternativeAppsDirectory
