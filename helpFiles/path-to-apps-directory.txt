[--path-to-apps-directory]

This flag can be used in conjunction with other rig flags to manually set the
Roady Apps directory path used by rig to an alternative
Apps directory path.

Typically it is not necessary to specify this flag. rig will attempt to locate
the Apps directory at the following path relative to rig's root directory:

    ../../../Apps

If rig cannot locate the expected Apps directory rig will use the path to
rig's tmp directory as the --path-to-apps-directory. rig's tmp directory will
be located in rig's root directory, for example:

/path/to/rig/tmp

WARNING: Unless you really need to, it is best to let rig manage the
--path-to-apps-directory flag's value to insure an appropriate path is used.

Examples:

rig --new-app --name Foo --path-to-apps-directory ~/AlternativeAppsDirectory

rig --new-request --name Foo --for-app Foo --path-to-apps-directory ~/AlternativeAppsDirectory
