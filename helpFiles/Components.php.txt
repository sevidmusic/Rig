  # Components.php

  Every roady App must define a Components.php. Typically, it is not
  necessary to create this file manually. If you use `rig --new-app`,
  or `rig --configure-app-output` to create your App the Components.php
  file will be created for you.

  ~~~
  The Components.php file is responsible for building an App for a
  domain.

  Unless you modify the generate Components.php file, or manually
  create your own, the Components.php file can be used to build
  an App for a domain by executing it with php.
