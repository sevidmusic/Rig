  # Components.php
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Every roady App must define a Components.php. Typically, it is not
  necessary to create this file manually. If you use `rig --new-app`,
  or `rig --configure-app-output` to create your App the Components.php
  file will be created for you.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The Components.php file is responsible for building an App for a
  domain.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Building an App for a domain makes the features provided by
  the App available to the domain the App is built for. 
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Unless you modify the generated Components.php file, or manually
  create your own, the Components.php file can be used to build
  an App for a domain by executing it with php.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  To build an App simply execute the relevant App's 
  Components.php via `php` passing the appropriate domain as the
  only argument, for example:
  ~~~
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080'
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The App must exist in roady's Apps directory to be built.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Warning: Do not include a trailing forward-slash at the end of the
  domain:
  ~~~
  Wrong:
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080/'
  ```
  Right:
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080'
  ```
