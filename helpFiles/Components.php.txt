  # Components.php
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Every roady App must define a Components.php. 
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The Components.php file is responsible for building an App for a
  domain.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Building an App for a domain makes the features provided by
  the App available to the domain the App is built for. 
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  It is not necessary to create this file manually. Whenever
  `rig --new-app`, or `rig --configure-app-output` is used to
  create a new App rig will create a Components.php file for the
  new App.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  To build an App simply execute the relevant App's 
  Components.php via `php` passing the appropriate domain as the
  only argument, for example:
  ~~~
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080'
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The App must exist in roady's Apps directory to be built.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Make sure to wrap the domain in single quotes.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Do not include a trailing forward-slash at the end of the
  domain:
  ~~~
  Wrong:
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080/'
  ```
  Right:
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080'
  ```

  This is a bug that is being addressed. See issue #193:

  WARNING: With rare exception, there is no reason to edit an 
  App's Components.php file, and it is usually best to let
  rig manage this file since a corrupted Components.php will 
  make an App un-buildable. Always use great care when modifying 
  an App's Components.php.
