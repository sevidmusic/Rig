  # Components.php
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Every roady App must define a Components.php. 
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The Components.php file is responsible for building an App 
  for a domain.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Building an App for a domain makes the features provided by
  the App available to the domain the App is built for. 
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  It is not necessary to create this file manually. Whenever
  `rig --new-app`, or `rig --configure-app-output` is used to
  create a new App rig will create a Components.php file for the
  new App.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  To build an App simply execute the relevant App's 
  Components.php via `php` passing the appropriate domain as the
  only argument, for example:
  ~~~
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080'
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The App must exist in roady's Apps directory to be built.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Make sure to wrap the domain in single quotes.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Do not include a trailing forward-slash at the end of the
  domain:
  ~~~
  Wrong:
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080/'
  ```
  Right:
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080'
  ```

  This is a bug that is being addressed. See issue #193:

  WARNING: With rare exception, there is no reason to edit an 
  App's Components.php file, and it is usually best to let
  rig manage this file since a corrupted Components.php will 
  make an App un-buildable. Always use great care when modifying 
  an App's Components.php.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The following is an example of a Components.php file generated
  by `rig --new-app` or `rig --configure-app-output`:

  /**
   * Components.php
   *
   * This file is used to configure an AppBuilder for the App.
   *
   * An AppBuilder is responsible for building an App for a domain
   * when an App's Components.php is executed via php.
   *
   *     For example:
   *
   *     php Apps/APPNAME/Components.php
   *
   * Unless you modify this file, the domain the App is built for 
   * will be determined as follows:
   *
   *     1. If a domain is specified via $argv[1] the App will be 
   *        built for that domain.
   *
   *        For example:
   *
   *            php Apps/APPNAME/Components.php \
   *                'https://roady.tech'
   *
   *        Would build the App for the domain:
   *
   *            https://roady.tech
   *
   *     2. If a domain is not specified via $argv[1], then 
   *        the App will be built for the hard coded domain 
   *        supplied as the $domain parameter to this files 
   *        call to the AppBuilder::getAppsAppComponentsFactory() 
   *        method.
   *
   *     3. If a domain is not specified via $argv[1], and the 
   *        hard-coded default $domain is empty, then the App 
   *        will be built for the domain:
   *
   *            http://localhost:8080
   *
   * WARNING: There is a bug that causes build issues if the 
   * domain supplied to Components.php contains an ending
   * forward slash.
   *
   * For example, the following hypothetical examples may fail to 
   * build the App:
   *
   *    php Apps/APPNAME/Components.php 
   *        'https://domain.with.ending.forward.slash/'
   *
   *    php Apps/APPNAME/Components.php 
   *        'http://localhost:8989/'
   *
   * @see https://github.com/sevidmusic/roady/issues/193
