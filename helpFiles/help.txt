  # Description:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  rig is a command line utility designed to aid in the development
  of roady Apps. rig provides a number of flags that can be used to
  perform common development tasks.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: To use rig, rig must be in your `$PATH`. rig's executable
  will be located at the following path relative to the relevant
  roady installation's root directory:
  ~~~
  ```
  ./vendor/darling/rig/bin/rig
  ```
  ~~~~~
  For example, if roady is installed at the following path:
  ~~~
  ```
  ~/roady
  ```
  ~~~~~
  Then rig can be added to your `$PATH` via:
  ~~~
  ```
  export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/roady/vendor/darling/rig/bin"
  ```
  ~~~~~
  Note: This will only add rig to your `$PATH` temporarily, to
  add it permanently you will need to set your `$PATH` in the
  appropriate configuration file for the shell you are using.
  For information on setting your `$PATH` permanently, please
  consult the documentation for the shell you are using.
  ~~~
  WARNING: If you have multiple installations of roady on your
  system, make sure the path to the rig executable defined in
  your `$PATH` matches the path to the rig executable located
  in the vendor directory of the roady installation you are
  currently working with, or else rig may perform actions on
  the wrong roady installation.
