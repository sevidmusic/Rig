Description:

rig is a command line utility designed to aide in the development process
with Roady. rig provides a number of flags
that can be used to perform common development tasks.


Flags:

[--assign-to-response]              Assign one or more Requests, OutputComponents,
                                    or DynamicOutputComponents to an existing
                                    Response or GlobalResponse for an existing
                                    Roady App.

[--configure-app-output]            Configure output for a specified App to
                                    show up in response to specified Requests.

                                    Note: If the specified App does not exist
                                    it will be created.

[--path-to-apps-directory]          The path to Roady Apps
                                    directory, or an alternative directory.

                                    If not specified, rig will attempt to locate
                                    the Apps directory, if it cannot find it rig
                                    will set --path-to-apps-directory to the path
                                    to rig's tmp directory.

                                    rig will look for the Apps directory at
                                    the following path relative to rig's root
                                    directory:

                                        ../../../Apps

                                    If the Apps directory cannot be located then
                                    the path to rig's tmp directory's will be
                                    assigned to the --path-to-apps-directory
                                    flag, for example:

                                        /path/to/rig/tmp

                                    Note: Typically, you do not need to
                                    specify the --path-to-apps-directory flag
                                    since rig will determine the appropriate
                                    path at runtime. The only reason to use this
                                    flag is if you explicitly want to target an
                                    alternative Apps directory.

                                    WARNING: Unless you really need to, it is
                                    best to let rig manage the
                                    --path-to-apps-directory flag's value to
                                    insure an appropriate path is used.

[--debug]                           Show debug information for the current call
                                    to rig. This flag is intended to be used in
                                    conjunction with other flags, not alone.

                                    The following arguments can be specified to
                                    control what debug information is shown, at
                                    least one is expected.

                                      flags :   This will cause rig to output
                                                the flags passed to rig and
                                                their arguments.

                                                For example:

                                                    rig --help --debug flags

                                      options : This will cause rig to output
                                                any options passed to rig,
                                                i.e, the arguments that were
                                                specified that are not
                                                associated with a flag.

                                                For example:

                                                    rig --help --debug options

                                                Note: The options argument is
                                                provided for future use, at the
                                                moment rig does not accept any
                                                options, only flags and flag
                                                arguments.

                                    For example:

                                        rig --help

Notes:

To get more detailed information about a specific flag you can use the --help
flag and specify one of the available flags as an argument.

Note: You do not need to include the flag's -- prefix when using --help.

WARNING: The path-to-apps-directory flag is the only flag that cannont be
passed to rig --help with the -- prefix.

    # Invalid, rig will interpret the following as an attempt to set the
    # --path-to-apps-directory flag's value:
    rig --help --path-to-apps-directory

    # Valid, rig will interpret the following as a reuest for the help
    # information for the --path-to-apps-directory flag:
    rig --help path-to-apps-directory

All other flags can be passed to --help with or without the -- prefix.

The following examples demonstrate how to use rig --help:

rig --help

rig --help assign-to-response
rig --help --assign-to-response

rig --help configure-app-output
rig --help --configure-app-output

rig --help path-to-apps-directory
