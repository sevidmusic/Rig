Description:

ddms is a command line utility designed to aide in the development process
with the Darling Data Management System. ddms provides a number of flags
that can be used to perform common development tasks.


Flags:

[--assign-to-response]              Assign one or more Requests, OutputComponents,
                                    or DynamicOutputComponents to an existing
                                    Response or GlobalResponse for an existing
                                    Darling Data Management System App.

[--configure-app-output]            Configure output for a specified App to
                                    show up in response to specified Requests.

                                    Note: If the specified App does not exist
                                    it will be created.

[--ddms-apps-directory-path]        The path to the Darling Data Management Apps
                                    directory, or an alternative directory.

                                    If not specified, ddms will attempt to locate
                                    the Apps directory, if it cannot find it ddms
                                    will set --ddms-apps-directory-path to the
                                    path to ddms's tmp directory.

                                    ddms will look for the Apps directory at
                                    the following path relative to ddms's root
                                    directory for an Apps directory:

                                      ../../../Apps

                                    Defaults to ddms's tmp directory's path:

                                      /path/to/ddms/tmp

                                    Note: Typically, you do not need to
                                    specify the --ddms-apps-directory-path flag
                                    since ddms will determine the appropriate
                                    path at runtime. The only reason to use this
                                    flag is if you explicitly want to target an
                                    alternative Apps directory.

                                    WARNING: Unless you really need to, it is
                                    probably best to let ddms manage this value
                                    to insure an appropriate path is used.

[--debug]                           Show debug information for the current call
                                    to ddms. This flag is intended to be used in
                                    conjunction with other flags, not alone.

                                    The following arguments can be specified to
                                    control what debug information is shown, at
                                    least one is expected.

                                      flags :   This will cause ddms to output
                                                the flags passed to ddms and
                                                their arguments.

                                      options : This will cause ddms to output
                                                any options passed to ddms,
                                                i.e, the arguments that were
                                                specified that are not
                                                associated with a flag.

                                                Note: The 'options' argument is
                                                provided for future use, at the
                                                moment ddms does not accept any
                                                options, only flags and flag
                                                arguments.
