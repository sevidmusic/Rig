  ### Description:

  ~~~
  rig is a command line utility designed to aide in the development of roady Apps.
  rig provides a number of flags that can be used to perform common development
  tasks.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  WARNING: Make sure rig is in your `$PATH` or you may have issues.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  rig's executable should be located at the following path relative to the
  relevant roady installation's root directory:
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
      `./vendor/darling/rig/bin/rig`
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  For example, if roady is installed at:
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
      `~/roady`
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  You could run the following to temporarily add rig to your `$PATH`:
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
      `export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/roady/vendor/darling/rig/bin"`
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Note: This step may be different from one shell to another. If you are using
  `sh` or `bash`, then the previous example should work.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  WARNING: If you have multiple installations of roady on your system, make sure
  the path to the rig executable defined in your `$PATH` matches the path to the
  rig executable located in the vendor directory of the roady installation you
  are currently working with, or else rig may perform actions on the wrong roady
  installation.
  ~~~~~

  ### Flags:

  ~~~```[--assign-to-response]```~~~~~              ~~~Assign one or more Requests,
                                      OutputComponents, or
                                      DynamicOutputComponents to an existing
                                      Response or GlobalResponse for an existing
                                      roady App.~~~~~

  ~~~```[--configure-app-output]```~~~~~            ~~~Configure output for a specified roady App
                                      to show up in response to specified
                                      requests to any domain the App is built
                                      for.~~~~~

                                      ~~~Note: If the specified App does not exist
                                      it will be created.~~~~~

  ~~~```[--path-to-apps-directory]```~~~~~          ~~~The path to roady's Apps directory, or an
                                      alternative directory.~~~~~

                                      ~~~If not specified, rig will attempt to
                                      locate roady's Apps directory.~~~~~

                                      ~~~rig will look for roady's Apps directory at
                                      the following path relative to rig's root
                                      directory:~~~~~

                                      ~~~
                                          `../../../Apps`
                                      ~~~~~

                                      ~~~If the Apps directory cannot be located
                                      there, then the path to rig's tmp
                                      directory will be used, for example:~~~~~
                                      ~~~
                                          `/path/to/rig/tmp`
                                      ~~~~~

                                      ~~~Note: Typically, you do not need to specify
                                      the `--path-to-apps-directory` flag since rig
                                      will determine an appropriate path at
                                      runtime.~~~~~

                                      ~~~The only reason to use this flag is if you
                                      explicitly want to target an alternative
                                      Apps directory.~~~~~

                                      ~~~WARNING: Unless you really need to, it is
                                      best to let rig manage the
                                      `--path-to-apps-directory` flag's value to
                                      insure an appropriate path is used.~~~~~

  ~~~```[--debug]```~~~~~                           ~~~Show debug information for the current call
                                      to rig. This flag is intended to be used in
                                      conjunction with other flags, not alone.~~~~~

                                      ~~~The following arguments can be specified to
                                      control what debug information is shown, at
                                      least one is expected.~~~~~

                                        ~~~`flags` :   This will cause rig to output
                                                  the flags passed to rig and
                                                  their arguments.~~~~~

                                                  ~~~For example:~~~~~

                                                      ~~~`rig --help --debug flags`~~~~~

                                        ~~~`options` : This will cause rig to output
                                                  any options passed to rig,
                                                  i.e, the arguments that were
                                                  specified that are not
                                                  associated with a flag.~~~~~

                                                  ~~~For example:~~~~~

                                                      ~~~`rig --help --debug options`~~~~~

                                                  ~~~Note: The options argument is
                                                  provided for future use, at the
                                                  moment rig does not accept any
                                                  options, only flags and flag
                                                  arguments.~~~~~
