  ```
  rig --new-request --for-app --name [--relative-url] [--container]
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### Description:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Configure a new Request for the specified App.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  A Request represents a specific request to a domain that the
  App has been built for.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Requests are defined using relative urls. This allows them to 
  be domain agnostic.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For example, if the `Foo` App already exists, the following 
  will define a Request that represents a request to a domain's 
  `index.php`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --new-request \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name IndexRequest \
      --relative-url 'index.php'
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If the `Foo` App is built for the domain, `http://localhost:8080`, 
  then the `IndexRequest` Request configured in the previous example 
  will represent the following request to `http://localhost:8080`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080/index.php
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Alternatively, if the `Foo` App is built for the domain, 
  `https://roady.tech` then the `IndexRequest` Request configured 
  in the previous example will represent the following request to
  `https://roady.tech`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  https://roady.tech/index.php
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### Flags:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~```--for-app```~~~~~      
                 ~~~
                 The name of the App to configure the new 
                 Request for.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 WARNING: The specified App must exist at the 
                 path that corresponds to the path assigned to 
                 the `--path-to-apps-directory` flag. If the App 
                 does not exist, the new Request will not be 
                 configured.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Note: It is unnecessary to specify the 
                 `--path-to-apps-directory` flag's value, 
                 rig will determine an appropriate path at 
                 runtime as long as the `--path-to-apps-directory`
                 flag is not specified.
                 ~~~
                 Note: It is best to let rig determine the value of 
                 the `--path-to-apps-directory` flag to insure an 
                 appropriate path is used.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Note: More information about the
                 `--path-to-apps-directory` flag can
                 be obtained via:
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 rig --help path-to-apps-directory
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~~~
  ~~~```--name```~~~~~         
                 ~~~
                 An alphanumeric name to assign to the new Request.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 WARNING: The name must be unique. rig will refuse 
                 to configure the new Request if a Request with the
                 same name already exists.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 WARNING: rig will refuse to configure the new 
                 Request if the name is not alphanumeric.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Note: If the name contains spaces, and is not 
                 quoted, only the alphanumeric characters up to 
                 the first space will be used. For example:
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 rig --new-request \
                     --for-app Foo \
                     --name Spaces In Name 
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 Would result in the assigned name: `Spaces`
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Note: If the name contains spaces, and is surrounded 
                 by quotes, then rig will refuse to configure the
                 new Request. For example, the following will fail:
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 rig --new-request \
                     --for-app Foo \
                     --name 'Spaces In Quoted Name'
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~~~
  ~~~```--relative-url```~~~~~ 
                 ~~~
                 A relative url to assign to the new Request. 
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 By default, the relative url '/' is assigned, 
                 which will correspond to the domain's root url. 
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 For example, the following would define a Request
                 that represents a request to the root of a domain:
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 rig --new-request \
                     --for-app Foo \
                     --name RootRequest
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 The specified relative url will correspond to a 
                 complete url when the App is built for a domain. 
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 For example, the following relative urls 
                 correspond to the following complete url 
                 patterns, where `{domain}` is replaced by 
                 the actual domain the App is built for:
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 ----------------------------------------------------
                 | Relative Url  <- Corresponds To ->  Complete Url |
                 ----------------------------------------------------
                 ?request=Foo       http://{domain}/?request=Foo

                 index.php?Bar=baz  http://{domain}/index.php?Bar=baz

                 /                  http://{domain}/
                 ```
                 ~~~~~

  ~~~```[--container]```~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 The name of the container to store the new 
                 Request's data in. This value is used when 
                 an App is built for a domain, it determines 
                 where in the Domain's storage the Request's 
                 data will be located after the App is built.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Defaults to: `Requests`
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 WARNING: rig will refuse to configure the new 
                 Request if the specified container name is not 
                 alphanumeric.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 For example, the following will fail:
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 rig --new-request \
                     --for-app Foo \
                     --name Bar \
                     --container '_Bad-Char$_' 
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Note: If the specified container name contains 
                 spaces, and is not quoted, only the alphanumeric 
                 characters up to the first space will be used. 
                 For example:
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 rig --new-request \
                     --for-app Foo \
                     --name Bar \
                     --container Spaces In Container 
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 Would result in the assigned container: `Spaces`
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Note: If the specified container name contains 
                 spaces, and is surrounded by quotes, then rig 
                 will refuse to configure the new Request. 
                 For example, the following will fail:
                 ~~~
                 ```

                 rig --new-request \
