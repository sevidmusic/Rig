  rig --new-request --for-app --name [--container] [--relative-url]
  ```

  ### Description:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Configure a new Request for the specified App.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  A Request represents a specific request to a domain the
  App has been built for.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Requests are defined using relative urls. This allows them to 
  be domain agnostic.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For example, the following would define a request that 
  represents a request to root of a domain:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --new-request \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name RootRequest \
      --relative-url '/'
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If the Foo App was built for the domain, `http://localhost:8080`, 
  then the Bar Request configured in the previous example would 
  represent the following request:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080/
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Alternatively, if the Foo App was built for the domain, 
  `https://roady.tech` then the Bar Request configured in the 
  previous example would represent the following request:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  https://roady.tech/
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### Flags:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~```--for-app```~~~~~      
                 ~~~
                 The name of the App to configure the new 
                 Request for.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 WARNING: The specified App must exist at the 
                 path that corresponds to the path assigned to 
                 the `--path-to-apps-directory` flag. If the App 
                 does not exist, the new Request will not be 
                 configured.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Note: It is unnecessary to specify the 
                 `--path-to-apps-directory` flag's value, 
                 rig will determine an appropriate path at 
                 runtime as long as the `--path-to-apps-directory`
                 flag is not specified.
                 ~~~
                 Note: It is best to let rig determine the value of 
                 the `--path-to-apps-directory` flag to insure an 
                 appropriate path is used.

                 ~~~
                 Note: More information about the
                 `--path-to-apps-directory` flag can
                 be obtained via:
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 rig --help path-to-apps-directory
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~~~
  ~~~```--name```~~~~~         
                 ~~~
                 A name to assign to the new Request.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 WARNING: The name must be unique, if a Request 
                 already exists with the same name the new 
                 Request will not be configured.
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 WARNING: The specified name must be 
                 alphanumeric or rig will refuse to configure 
                 the Request. 
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 WARNING: If the specified name contains spaces, 
                 only the alphanumeric characters up to the 
                 first space will be used. 
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 For example:
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 rig --new-request \
                 --for-app Foo \
                 --name 'Spaces In Alphanumeric Name'
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Would result in the assigned name: `Spaces`
                 ~~~~~
  ~~~```--relative-url```~~~~~ 
                 ~~~
                 A relative url to assign to the new Request. 
                 This relative url will correspond to a 
                 complete url when an App is built for a domain
                 . By default, the relative url '/' is assigned 
                 which will correspond to the domain's root url. 
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 For example:
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 ?request=Foo
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 corresponds to 
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 ```
                 http://{domain}/?request=Foo
                 ```
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 Defaults to relative root url:
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 `/`
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 The default corresponds to:
                 ~~~~~
                 ~~~
                 `http://{domain}/`
                 ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### Examples:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --new-request \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name Bar

  rig --new-request \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name Baz \
      --container CustomContainer \
      --relative-url "?request=Baz"

  rig --new-request \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name Bin \
      --relative-url "?Foo=bar&baz=biz"
