  # Apps
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Apps are used to implement niche features that can be made
  available to one or more websites running on a single
  installation of roady.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  New App's can be created with either `rig --new-app` or
  `rig --configure-app-output`.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For information about `rig --new-app` use:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```rig --help --new-app```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For information about `rig --configure-app-output` use:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```rig --help --configure-app-output```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The structure of an App is as follows:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  Components.php
  css
  js
  DynamicOutput
  OutputComponents
  Requests
  Responses
  resources
  ```
  ~~~~~

  # Overview
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  ### Components.php
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The `Components.php` file is used to build the App for a specific
  domain.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For example, to create an App named `Foo` and build it for the
  domain https://foobar.baz:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --new-app --name Foo

  php /path/to/roady/Apps/Foo/Components.php 'https://foobar.baz'
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: Foo's Components.php will be generated when `rig --new-app` is run.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  ### css
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The `css` directory is where an Apps stylsheets should be placed.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Apps can define stylesheets that are loaded in response to
  specific Requests to the domains an App is built for, or can
  define stylesheets that are loaded in response to all Requests to
  the domains an App is built for.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If the name of a stylesheet defined by an App contains the word
  `global`, it will be loaded in response to all Requests to the
  domains that the App is built for.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If the stylesheet's name does not contain the word `global`, then the
  stylesheet will only be loaded in response to Requests whose name
  matches the name of the stylesheet, excluding the `.css` extension.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For instance, if a stylesheet named `global-styles.css`
  is defined by an App named HelloWorld, and the HelloWorld App is
  built for the domain http://localhost:8080, then `global-styles.css`
  will be loaded in response to all Requests to the domain
  http://localhost:8080.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If the HelloWorld App also defined a stylesheet named `homepage.css`,
  then `homepage.css` would only be loaded in response to Requests
  that have the name `homepage`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For Example:
  ~~~~~

      ~~~
      http://localhost:8080?request=homepage
      ~~~~~

      ~~~
      http://localhost:8080/index.php?request=homepage
      ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Note: The name of the Request will correspond to the value of
  `$_GET['request']`.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  ### js
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The `js` directory is where an Apps scripts should be placed.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: There are plans to implment similar functionality
  for loading App javascript files as is currently used to
  load App css files. See issue #234:

  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  ### DynamicOutput
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The `DynamicOutput` directory is where an Apps Dynamic Output
  files should be placed. These files are used to generate output
  for DynamicOutputComponents.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  ### OutputComponents
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The `OutputComponents` directory is where an Apps OutputComponent
  and DynamicOutputComponent configuration files should be placed.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  ### Requests
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The `Requests` directory is where an Apps Request configuration
  files should be placed.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  ### Responses
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The `Responses` directory is where an Apps Response and
  GlobalResponse configuration files should be placed.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  ### resources
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The `resources` directory is where any additional resources
  provided by, or required by the App should be placed.
