ddms --make-app-package --path

Description:

Make an App Package into an App. The new App will either be placed in the Darling
Data Management System's App's directory, or the ddms's tmp directory if the
Darling Data Management Sytem's App's directory path cannot be determined or does
not exist.

For example, ddms --make-app-package --path /path/to/AppPackage/Foo would
create the Foo App in either:

  /path/to/DarlingDataManagementSystem/Apps/Foo

  or, if Darling Data Management System's Apps directory path is not found:

  /path/to/ddms/tmp/Foo

WARNING: If an App whose name matches the name of the App to be made already
         exists at the path where the new App will be made, the original App
         will be replaced!

Note: With the exception of files ending in extension .sh, any files or
      directories that exist in the App Package will be copied to a
      corresponding path in the new App.

Flags:

--path The path to the App Package to make.

Examples:

ddms --make-app-package --path /path/to/AppPackage
