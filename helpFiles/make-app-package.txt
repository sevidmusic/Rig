rig --make-app-package --path

Description:

Make an App Package into an App. The newly made App will be located at the path
that corresponds to the value assigned to the --path-to-apps-directory flag.

For example, if --path-to-apps-directory is assigned the path:

    /path/to/roady/Apps

Then rig --make-app-package --path /path/to/AppPackage/Foo would make the Foo
App at:

    /path/to/roady/Apps/Foo

Note:    You do not need to explicitly set the --path-to-apps-directory unless
         you intend to use an alternative Apps directory.
         --path-to-apps-directory's assigned value will be determined by rig
         at runtime unless it is set explicitly.

WARNING: If an App whose name matches the name of the App to be made already exists
         at the path where the new App will be made, the original App will be
         replaced! Be careful with this command, any directory whose name matches
         the specified --name that exists at the --path-to-apps-directory will
         be replaced by the newly made App.

Note:    With the exception of files ending in extension .sh, any files or
         directories that exist in the App Package will be copied to a
         corresponding path in the new App.

Flags:

--path The path to the App Package to make.

       WARNING: If the specified path is not valid, or the path specified does
       not point to a directory that contains a valid rig make.sh, then the
       App will not be made.

       A valid make.sh is just a bash script that contains at least one call to
       rig --new-app that assigns the App a name that matches the specified
       --name. For example, a valid make.sh for an App named Foo may look like:

           #!/bin/bash

           set -o posix

           rig --new-app --name Foo

Examples:

rig --make-app-package --path /path/to/AppPackage
