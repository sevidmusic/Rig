  ddms --make-app-package --path

  Description:

  Make an App Package into an App.

  WARNING: If an App whose name matches the name of the App to be made already exists,
           it will be replaced!

  Note: With the exception of files ending in extension .sh, any files or directories
        that exist in the App Package will be copied to a corresponding path in the
        new App.

        For example, if the App Package defines a styles.css in AppPackage/css/styles.css
        it will be copied to NewApp/css/styles.css.

  Flags:

  --path The path to the App Package to make.

  Examples:

  ddms --make-app-package --path /path/to/AppPackage
