  ddms --make-app-package --path

  Description:

        copied to a corresponding path in the new App created by the App Package.
        For example, if the App Package defines a styles.css in AppPackage/css/styles.css
        it will be copied to NewApp/css/styles.css.

  Flags:

  --path The path to the App Package to make.
