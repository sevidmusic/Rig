Description:

Create a new DynamicOutputComponent for the specified App.

Flags:

--for--app                   The name of the App to create the new DynamicOutputComponent
                             for.

--name                       An alphanumeric name to assign to the new DynamicOutputComponent.

[--container]                The container to store the new DynamicOutputComponent
                             data in, defaults to DynamicOutput.

[--position]                 A numeric position to assign to the new DynamicOutputComponent,
                             defaults to 0.

[--file-name]                The name of the file that generates the DynamicOutputComponent's
                             output. If not specified, the file-name will be assumed to match
                             --name with the .php extension appended, for example:

                               ddmms --new-dynamic-output-component --for-app Foo --name Foo

                             Would assume the --file-name to be:

                               Foo.php

                             ddms will create the file if it does not already exist.

                             The file is expected to exist either in the relevant
                             App's DynamicOutput directory, or, if the --shared
                             flag is specified, in the expected Darling Data
                             Management System's SharedDynamicOutput directory.

[--initial-output]           The initial output to assign as the content of the
                             new dynamic output file that will be created for
                             the new DynamicOutputComponent. This flag will fail
                             if the creation of the new dynamic output file would
                             overwrite an existing dynamic output file. It will
                             also fail if the --initial-output-file flag is also
                             specified.

[initial-output-file]        A path to a file whose content will be used as the
                             new dynamic output file that will be created for
                             the new DynamicOutputComponent. This flag will fail
                             if the creation of the new dynamic output file would
                             overwrite an existing dynamic output file. It will
                             also fail if the --initial-output flag is also
                             specified.


[--shared]                   If specified, ddms will assume the file that generates
                             the output for the DynamicOutputComponent exists,
                             or should be created at the following path relative
                             to the --ddms-apps-directory-path:

                             ../SharedDynamicOutput

                             If the dynamic output file has to be created, and the
                             --shared flag is specified, and the SharedDynamicOutput
                             directory does not exist at the expected path, it will
                             be created.

[--ddms-apps-directory-path] Path to the Darling Data Management Apps
                             directory or, an alternative directory.

                             If not specified, ddms will attempt to locate
                             the Apps directory, if it cannot find it ddms
                             will set --ddms-apps-directory-path to the
                             path to ddms's tmp directory.

                             ddms will look for the Apps directory at
                             the following path relative to ddms's root
                             directory:

                               ../../../Apps

                             Defaults to:

                               ./tmp

Examples:

ddms --new-dynamic-output-component --for-app Foo --name Foo --container FooOutput

ddms --new-dynamic-output-component --for-app Foo --name Foo --position 3

ddms --new-dynamic-output-component --for-app Foo --name Foo --file-name Baz.html --shared
