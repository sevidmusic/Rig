     [--shared]

Description:

Configure a new DynamicOutputComponent for the specified App.

Flags:

--for--app                   The name of the App to configure the new
                             DynamicOutputComponent for.

                             WARNING: The specified App must exist, if it does
                             not, the new DynamicOutputComponent will not be
                             configured.

--name                       An alphanumeric name to assign to the new
                             DynamicOutputComponent.

                             WARNING: The name must be unique, if a
                             DynamicOutputComponent already exists with the
                             same name, the new DynamicOutputComponent will not
                             be configured.

                             WARNING: The name must be alphanumeric with no
                             spaces, if spaces or non-alphanumeric characters are
                             present in the specified name, only the alphanumeric
                             characters up to the first space or non-alphanumeric
                             character will be used.

                             For example:

                                 ddms --new-dynamic-output-component \
                                 --for-app Foo \
                                 --name 'Spaces & Bad Chars' \
                                 --initial-output 'barBaz Foo'

                             Would result in the assigned name:

                                 Spaces

                             It is also possible that ddms will refuse to
                             configure the DynamicOutputComponent if an
                             alphanumeric name cannot be derived from a name that
                             contains spaces or non-alphanumeric characters.
                             This may happen, for instance, if the specified name
                             starts with a non-alphanumeric character.

[--container]                The container to store the new
                             DynamicOutputComponent's data in. This value is used
                             when an App is built for a domain, it determines
                             where in the Domain's storage the
                             DynamicOutputComponent's data will be located after
                             the App is built.

                             Defaults to: DynamicOutputComponents

[--position]                 The position to assign to the DynamicOutputComponent.
                             This position will be used to sort the
                             DynamicOutputComponent relative to other
                             DynamicOutputComponents and OutputComponents that
                             are served by the same Response or GlobalResponse.

                             Defaults to: 0

[--file-name]                Either the name of file that already exists in the
                             App's DynamicOutput directory, or the name to assign
                             to the file that will be created for the
                             DynamicOutputComponent in the App's DynamicOutput
                             directory.

                             Note: If the --shared flag is specified, then the
                             file will be created or expected to exist in
                             the Darling Data Management System's
                             SharedDynamicOutput directory instead of in the
                             App's DynamicOutput directory.

                             Note: The path to the Darling Data Management System
                             SharedDynamicOutput directory will correspond to the
                             following path relative to the path assigned to the
                             --ddms-apps-directory-path flag:

                                ../SharedDynamicOutput

                             Note: If the --file-name flag is not specified, the file
                             name will be assumed to match the specified --name,
                             with the extension ".php" appended.

[--initial-output]           The initial output to assign as the content of the
                             new file that will be created for the new
                             DynamicOutputComponent.

                             WARNING:
                             ddms will fail if the creation of the new file
                             would overwrite an existing file.

                             WARNING:
                             The --initial-output and --initial-output-file flags
                             cannot be used in conjunction with each other, if
                             they are both specified ddms will not configure the
                             new DynamicOutputComponent.

[initial-output-file]        A path to a file whose content will be used as the
                             contents of the new file that will be created to
                             generate output for the new DynamicOutputComponent.

                             WARNING:
                             ddms will fail if the specified file does not
                             exist.

                             WARNING:
                             ddms will fail if the creation of the new file
                             would overwrite an existing file.

                             WARNING:
                             The --initial-output-file and --initial-output flags
                             cannot be used in conjunction with each other, if
                             they are both specified ddms will not configure the
                             new DynamicOutputComponent.

[--shared]                   If specified, ddms will assume the file that generates
                             the output for the DynamicOutputComponent exists,
                             or should be created at the following path relative
                             to the --ddms-apps-directory-path:

                             ../SharedDynamicOutput

                             If the file has to be created, and the --shared flag
                             is specified, and the SharedDynamicOutput directory
                             does not exist at the expected path, it will be
                             created.

Examples:

ddms --new-dynamic-output-component \
--for-app Foo \
--name Bar \
--initial-output 'Foo bar bazzer'

ddms --new-dynamic-output-component \
--for-app Foo \
--name Bin \
--container 'SpecifiedContainer' \
--file-name 'SpecifiedFileName.txt' \
--initial-output-file /path/to/intial/output/file.txt \
--position '2.7' \
--shared
