  # Dynamic Output
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Apps can serve output that is generated from a file
  in the App's `DynamicOutput` directory.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  These files can be php files, html files, plain text files, or
  any other type of file.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: php files will be interpreted as executable php code, all 
  other files will be interpreted as plain text.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  In order for a DynamicOutput file to generate output for a 
  roady App, a DynamicOutputComponent must be configured for the 
  DynamicOutput file.

  More information on configuring DynamicOutputComponents can be
