  Javascript files must be provided by roady App to be utilized 
  by a website running on roady.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  An App's javascript files must be located in the App's `js` 
  directory.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: At the moment, javascript files must be served via an 
  OutputComponent or DynamicOutputComponent that generates 
  the html for the `<script>` tags to load the appropriate 
  javascript files.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  In future versions of roady javascript files will be loaded 
  the same way as stylesheets are currently loaded.
