  # Javascript

  Scripts must be provided by roady App to be served by a website
  running on roady.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  An App's scripts must be located in the App's `js` directory.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Warning: At the moment, scripts must be served via an OutputComponent or
  DynamicOutputComponent that generates the html for the
  `<script>` tags to load the appropriate scripts.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  However, this will not be the case for long, in future versions of roady
  scripts will be loaded the same way as stylesheets are currently loaded.
  See issue #234:

  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Issue #234 will be resolved in the next few weeks, so for now this
  section of the documentation will remain incomplete since the
  steps to load javscript files are about to change.
