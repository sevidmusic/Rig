  # Javascript
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Javascript files must be provided by a roady App to be utilized 
  by a website running on roady.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  An App's javascript files must be located in the App's `js` 
  directory.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  In order for a javascript file to be loaded, a OutputComponent 
  or DynamicOutputComponent must be created whose output is the 
  `<script>` tag that will be used to load the javascript file.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  This OutputComponent or DynamicOutputComponent can then be 
  assigned to one or more Responses or GlobalResponses.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: More information about OutputComponents can be obtained via:
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --help OutputComponents
  ```

  ~~~
  Note: More information about DynamicOutputComponents can be 
  obtained via:
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --help DynamicOutputComponents
  ```

  Note: In future versions of roady javascript files will be loaded 
  the same way as css stylesheets are currently loaded.
