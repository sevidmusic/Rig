# roady

~~~
roady is a tool designed to aid in the development of websites.
~~~~~

~~~
Its design allows the features of a website to be implemented as smaller niche
applications called Apps.
~~~~~

~~~
roady Apps are responsible for implementing one or more related features.
~~~~~

~~~
The features an App provides can be made available to multiple websites running
on a single installation of roady.
~~~~~

~~~
Apps can configure output to show up in response to appropriate requests to a
website, and can also provide stylesheets, scripts, and other resources
necessary to implement the specific features they provide.
