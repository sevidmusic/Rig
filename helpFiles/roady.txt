  # A note from the developer:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  I developed roady as a tool for myself, and I share it humbly as
  an example of my work and learning.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  I love coding, I love to learn about coding, and I love to build
  things for the experience, and for the knowledge gained from
  that experience.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is not a fully-featured framework, nor is it intended to be.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady and rig are my own personal experiments, and will continue to
  evolve based on my own needs.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Though roady and rig are still works in progress, they are ready
  for use.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  https://roady.tech was developed with roady and rig, and is running
  on roady.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  My personal website, https://sevidmusic.com, was developed with
  roady and rig, and is also running on roady.
