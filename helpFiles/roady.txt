  # roady
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is a tool designed to aid in the development of websites.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  With roady, the features of a website are implemented by
  small niche applications called Apps.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady Apps may provide css stylesheets, utilize javascript, and
  may configure output to be served in response to appropriate requests
  to a website's domain.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Multiple websites can run on a single installation of roady, each
  making use of one or more roady Apps.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is a unique tool, an ongoing experiment, developed out of a
  passion for coding.

  # Quick Installation, Setup, & Hello World Example
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The following is a quick demonstration of how to install
  and setup roady, and how to create a Hello World App.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The following example only demonstrates the necessary
  commands to run at the command line, it does not provide any
  details about the commands being executed.

  Note: Once roady is installed, and the rig command line
  utility is in your `$PATH`, then the getting-started documentation
  will be accessible locally from the command line via:

  ### Install roady:
  ```
  cd ~/

  git clone https://github.com/sevidmusic/roady.git
  ```

  ### Setup via composer:
  ```
  cd ~/roady

  composer update
  ```

  ### Add  the rig command line utility to your `$PATH`:
  ```
  export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/roady/vendor/darling/rig/bin"
  ```

  ### Use rig to create a roady App named `HelloWorld`:
  ```
  rig --configure-app-output \
  --for-app HelloWorld \
  --name HelloWorld \
  --output 'Hello World' \
  --relative-urls '/'
  ```

  ### Build the `HelloWorld` App for the local domain: `http://localhost:8080`:
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080'
  ```

  ### Start a development server for the local domain `http://localhost:8080`:
  ```
  rig --start-server --open-in-browser
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The output of the `HelloWorld` App should now be available at the
  local domain: `http://localhost:8080`.

  # A note from the developer:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  I want to emphasize that I developed roady as a tool for myself, and
  I share it humbly as an example of my work and learning.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  I love coding, I love to learn about coding, and I love to build
  things for the experience, and for the knowledge gained from that
  experience.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is not a fully-featured framework, nor is it intended to be.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is my own personal experiment, and will continue to evolve
  based on my own needs.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If you need a framework that's feature packed, designed to
  accommodate a large number of use cases, that is developed, used,
  and supported by a large community of incredible developers, then
  please use Laravel, Symphony, or any of the other wonderful open
  source PHP projects that have a solid reputation and years of work
  behind them.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  However, if you like to tinker and try new things solely out of
  curiosity, then I hope you'll give roady a try.
