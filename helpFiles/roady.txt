  # roady
  ~~~
  roady is a tool designed to aid in the development of websites.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Its design allows the features of a website to be implemented as smaller niche
  applications called Apps.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The features an App provides can be made available to multiple websites running
  on a single installation of roady.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Apps can configure output to show up in response to appropriate requests to a
  website, and can also provide stylesheets, scripts, and other resources
  necessary to implement the specific features they provide.
