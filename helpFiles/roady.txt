  roady is a tool designed to aid in the development of websites.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  With roady, the features of a website are implemented by
  small niche applications called Apps.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady Apps may provide stylesheets, scripts, and may configure output
  to be served in response to appropriate requests to a website's
  domain.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Multiple websites can run on a single installation of roady, each
  making use of one or more roady Apps.

  ~~~
  roady is available on github at:

  documentation locally via:

  # A note from the developer:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  I want to emphasize that I developed roady as a tool for myself, and
  I share it humbly as an example of my work and learning.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  I love coding, I love to learn about coding, and I love to build things
  for the experience, and for the knowledge gained from that experience.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is not a fully-featured framework, nor is it intended to be.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is my own personal experiment, and will continue to evolve
  based on my own needs.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If you need a framework that's feature packed, designed to
  accommodate a large number of use cases, and is developed used and
  supported by a large community of incredible developers please use
  Laravel, Symphony, or any of the other wonderful open source PHP
  projects that have a solid reputation and years of work behind them.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  However, if you like to tinker and try new things solely out of
  curiosity, then I hope you'll give roady a try. If you have any
  questions or feedback roady is on twitter and reddit:
