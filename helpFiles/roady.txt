  roady is a tool designed to aid in the development of websites.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The features of a website are implemented by small niche
  applications called Apps.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The features an App implements can be made available to multiple
  websites running on a single installation of roady.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Apps can configure output be served in Response to appropriate
  Requests to a website, and can also provide stylesheets, scripts,
  or any other resources necessary to implement the specific features
  they are responsible for.
