roady

roady is a tool designed to aid in the development of websites.

Its design allows the features of a website to be implemented as smaller niche applications called Apps.

roady Apps are responsible for implementing one or more related features.

The features an App provides can be made available to multiple websites running on a single installation of roady.

Apps can configure output to show up in response to appropriate requests to a website, and can also provide stylesheets, scripts, and other resources necessary to implement the specific features they provide.

New documentation is being added to https://roady.tech regularly.

Version 1.0 will be out soon.
