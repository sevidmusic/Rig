  ~~~
  roady is a tool designed to aid in the development of websites.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The features of a website are implemented by small niche
  applications called Apps.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Apps may provide stylesheets, scripts, and may configure output
  to be served in response to appropriate requests to a website's
  domain.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Multiple websites can run on a single installation of roady, each
  making use of one or more roady Apps.
