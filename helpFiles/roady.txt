  # roady
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is a tool designed to aid in the development of websites.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  With roady, the features of a website are implemented by
  small niche applications called Apps.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady Apps may provide css stylesheets, utilize javascript, and
  may configure output to be served in response to appropriate 
  requests to a website's domain.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Multiple websites can run on a single installation of roady, 
  each making use of one or more roady Apps.

  ### 1. Install roady:
  ```
  cd ~/

  git clone https://github.com/sevidmusic/roady.git
  ```

  ### 2. Setup via composer:
  ```
  cd ~/roady

  composer update
  ```

  ### 3. Add  the rig command line utility to your `$PATH`:
  ```
  export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/roady/vendor/darling/rig/bin"
  ```

  ### 4. Use rig to create a roady App named `HelloWorld`:
  ```
  rig --configure-app-output \
  --for-app HelloWorld \
  --name HelloWorld \
  --output 'Hello World' \
  --relative-urls '/'
  ```

  ### 5. Build the `HelloWorld` App for the local domain: `http://localhost:8080`:
  ```
  php ~/roady/Apps/HelloWorld/Components.php \
  'http://localhost:8080'
  ```

  ### 6. Start a development server for the local domain `http://localhost:8080`:
  ```
  rig --start-server --open-in-browser
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The output of the `HelloWorld` App should now be available at the
  following local urls: 
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080/?request=HelloWorld
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080/index.php?request=HelloWorld

  # A note from the developer:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  I want to emphasize that I developed roady as a tool for myself, 
  and I share it humbly as an example of my work and learning.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  I love coding, I love to learn about coding, and I love to build
  things for the experience, and for the knowledge gained from 
  that experience.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is not a fully-featured framework, nor is it intended 
  to be.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  roady is my own personal experiment, and will continue to evolve
  based on my own needs.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  If you need a framework designed to accommodate a large number 
  of use cases, that is developed, used, and supported by a 
  large community of incredible developers, then please use 
  Laravel, Symphony, or any of the other wonderful open source 
  PHP projects that have a solid reputation and years of work 
  behind them.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  However, if you like to tinker and try new things solely out of
  curiosity, then I hope you'll give roady a try.
