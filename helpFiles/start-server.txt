ddms --start-server [--port] [--root-directory] [--ini-file]

Description:

Start a PHP built in server instance at http://localhost:[--port]

WARNING: Do not use PHP's built in server in production, it is meant for development
         only. For more information view the documentation at:

         https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php

Once a sever is started, it can be used to run one or more Darling Data Managment
System Apps in development.

To get a list of active servers use ddms --view-active-servers

Flags:

[--port]              A port between 8000 and 8999. Defaults to: 8080

[--root-dir]          The directory to use as the server's root directory.
                      Defaults to directory above --ddms-apps-directory-path.
                      For example, if --ddms-apps-directory-path is:

                         $HOME/DarlingDataManagementSystem/Apps

                      Then default --root-dir will be:

                         $HOME/DarlingDataManagementSystem

[--ini-file]          Path to a php.ini file to use to configure php for the
                      server instance. This flag is optional, no default.

[--open-in-browser]   Attempt to open the root url for the new server instance
                      in a web broswer via xdg-open.

                      WARNING: This flag will not always work. It uses xdg-open
                               under the hood, if xdg-open is not available then
                               this flag will fail.

                               Also, if multiple built in server instances were
                               started with this flag present, this flag may begin
                               to fail as the number of server instances started
                               with this flag increases.
Examples:

ddms --start-server

ddms --start-server --port 8927 --open-in-browser

ddms --start-server --port 8975 --root-directory "${HOME}/DarlingDataManagementSystem/"
