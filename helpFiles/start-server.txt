ddms --start-server [--ini-file] [--port] [--root-directory]

Description:

Start a php built in server instance at http://localhost:[--port]

WARNING: Do not use php's built in server in production, it is meant for
         development only. For more information view the documentation at:

         https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php

Once a sever is started, it can be used to run one or more Darling Data Managment
System Apps locally.

To get a list of active development servers use: ddms --view-active-servers

Flags:

[--ini-file]          Path to the php.ini file to use to configure php for the
                      development server instance. This flag is optional, and
                      does not have a default value.

[--port]              A port number to start the development server instance on.
                      Defaults to: 8080

[--root-dir]          The directory to use as the development server instance's
                      root directory.

                      Defaults to the directory above --ddms-apps-directory-path.
                      For example, if --ddms-apps-directory-path is:

                          $HOME/DarlingDataManagementSystem/Apps

                      Then default --root-dir will be:

                          $HOME/DarlingDataManagementSystem

                      If the --ddms-apps-directory-path is:

                          $HOME/ddms/tmp

                      Then the default --root-dir will be:

                          $HOME/ddms

[--open-in-browser]   Attempt to open the root url of the new development server
                      instance in a web browser via xdg-open.

                      WARNING: This flag will not always work. It uses xdg-open
                               under the hood, if xdg-open is not available then
                               this flag will fail.

                               Also, if multiple built in server instances were
                               started with this flag present, this flag may
                               begin to fail as the number of server instances
                               started with this flag increases.

                      If ddms does not open the development server instance's url
                      in a web browser, you can access the server by opening the
                      appropriate url in a web browser manually.

                      More information is available about xdg-open at:

                          https://portland.freedesktop.org/doc/xdg-open.html

Examples:

ddms --start-server

ddms --start-server --port 8927 --open-in-browser

ddms --start-server --port 8975 --root-directory "${HOME}/AlternativeRootDir/"
