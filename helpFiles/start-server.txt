  ### Description:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Start a php built in server instance.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  WARNING: Do not use php's built in server in production,
  it is meant for development only.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  More information about Php's built in server can be found
  online:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Once a sever is started, it can be used to run one or more
  roady Apps locally by building the desired Apps for a domain
  that corresponds to the running development server instance's
  url.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For example, to run an existing App named Foo locally
  on http://localhost:8080:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### 1. Build the Foo App for the domain 'http://localhost:8080'
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  php /path/to/roady/Apps/Foo/Components.php \
      'http://localhost:8080'
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### 2. Start a local development server on port 8080
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --start-server --port 8080
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: The Foo App is now running on 'http://localhost:8080' and
  can be accessed via a web browser.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  To get a list of active development servers use:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --view-active-servers
  ```

  ### Flags:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~```[--ini-file]```~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        Path to the php.ini file to use to
                        configure php for the development
                        server instance. This flag is
                        optional, and does not have a default
                        value.
                        ~~~~~
  ~~~```[--port]```~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        A port number to start the development
                        server instance on.
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        Defaults to: `8080`
                        ~~~~~
  ~~~```[--root-dir]```~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        The directory to use as the development
                        server instance's root directory.
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        Defaults to the parent directory of the
                        directory located at the path assigned
                        to the --path-to-apps-directory flag.
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        For example, if the path assigned to the
                        --path-to-apps-directory flag is:
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        ```
                        ~/roady/Apps
                        ```
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        Then the default --root-dir will be:
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        ```
                        ~/roady
                        ```
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        If the --path-to-apps-directory is:
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        ```
                        ~/rig/tmp
                        ```
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        Then the default --root-dir will be:
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        ```
                        ~/rig
                        ```
                        ~~~~~
                        ~~~
                        Note: It is typically not necessary to
                        specify the --root-dir flag since rig
                        will typically determine the correct
                        root directory for you, however, if
                        you find rig is unable to determine
                        the correct root directory to use for
                        the development server instance, or if
                        an alternative root directory needs to
                        be used, the --root-dir flag can be used
                        to manually set the appropriate path.
                        ~~~~~
  ~~~```[--open-in-browser]```~~~~~
                        ~~~

                        development server instance in a web
                        browser via xdg-open.

                        WARNING: This flag will not always work.
                        It uses xdg-open under the hood, if
                        `xdg-open` is not available then this
                        flag will fail.

                        ~~~
                        Also, this flag may begin to fail as
                        the number of server instances started
                        increases.

                        instance is running.
