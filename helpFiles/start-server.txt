rig --start-server [--ini-file] [--port] [--root-directory]
     [--open-in-browser]

Description:

Start a php built in server instance at http://localhost:[--port]

WARNING: Do not use php's built in server in production, it is meant for
         development only. For more information view the documentation at:

         https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php

Once a sever is started, it can be used to run one or more Darling Data
Management System Apps locally by building the Apps to run for a domain that
corresponds to a running development server instance's url.

For example, to run an existing App named Foo locally on http://localhost:8080:

    # Build the App for the domain 'http://localhost:8080'
    php /path/to/DarlingDataManagementSystem/Apps/Foo/Components.php 'http://localhost:8080'

    # Start a local development server on port 8080
    rig --start-server --port 8080

    # The Foo App is now running on 'http://localhost:8080'

To get a list of active development servers use: rig --view-active-servers

Flags:

[--ini-file]          Path to the php.ini file to use to configure php for the
                      development server instance. This flag is optional, and
                      does not have a default value.

[--port]              A port number to start the development server instance on.
                      Defaults to: 8080

[--root-dir]          The directory to use as the development server instance's
                      root directory.

                      Defaults to the directory above --path-to-apps-directory.
                      For example, if --path-to-apps-directory is:

                          $HOME/DarlingDataManagementSystem/Apps

                      Then default --root-dir will be:

                          $HOME/DarlingDataManagementSystem

                      If the --path-to-apps-directory is:

                          $HOME/rig/tmp

                      Then the default --root-dir will be:

                          $HOME/rig

                      Note: It is typically not necessary to specify the
                      --root-dir flag since rig will typically determine the
                      correct root directory for you, however, if you find rig
                      is unable to determine the correct root directory to use
                      for the development server instance, or if an alternative
                      root directory needs to be used, the --root-dir flag can be
                      used to manually set the appropriate path.

[--open-in-browser]   Attempt to open the root url of the new development server
                      instance in a web browser via xdg-open.

                      WARNING: This flag will not always work. It uses xdg-open
                               under the hood, if xdg-open is not available then
                               this flag will fail.

                               Also, this flag may begin to fail as the number of
                               server instances started increases.

                      More information is available about xdg-open at:

                          https://portland.freedesktop.org/doc/xdg-open.html

                      Note: A development server instance's url can always be
                      opened manually via a web browser while the development
                      server instance is running.

Examples:

rig --start-server

rig --start-server --port 8927 --open-in-browser

rig --start-server --port 8975 --root-directory "${HOME}/AlternativeRootDir/"
