ddms --new-response --for-app --name [--position]

Description:

Configure a new Response for the specified App.

Flags:

--for-app    The name of the App to configure the Response for.

             WARNING: The specified App must exist, if it does not, the new
             Response will not be configured.

--name       A name to assign to the new Response.

             WARNING: The name must be unique, if a Response already
             exists with the same name the new Response will not be
             configured.

             WARNING: The name must be alphanumeric with no spaces, if spaces
             or non-alphanumeric characters are present in the specified name,
             only the alphanumeric characters up to the first space or
             non-alphanumeric character will be used.

             For example:

                 ddms --new-response \
                 --for-app foo \
                 --name 'Spaces & Bad Chars'

             Would result in the assigned name:

                 Spaces

             It is also possible that ddms will refuse to configure the Response
             if an alphanumeric name cannot be derived from a name that
             contains spaces or non-alphanumeric characters. This may happen,
             for instance, if the specified name starts with a non-alphanumeric
             character.

[--position] The position to assign to the Response. This position is used to
             sort the Response relative to other Responses and GlobalResponses
             that respond to the same Request.
             Defaults to: 0

Examples:

ddms --new-response --for-app Foo --name Bar

ddms --new-response --for-app Foo --name Baz --position 3.5
