  ```
  rig --new-response --for-app --name [--position]
  ```

  ### Description:

  ~~~
  Configure a new Response for the specified App.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  The purpose of a Response is to serve output in response to appropriate
  requests to any domains that the App is built for.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  For example, the following:
  ~~~~~

      ```
      rig --new-app \
      --name Foo

      rig --new-request \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name BarRequest \
      --relative-url 'index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer'

      rig --new-output-component \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name BarOutput \
      --output 'Hello World'

      rig --new-response \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name BarResponse

      rig --assign-to-response \
      --for-app Foo \
      --response BarResponse \
      --requests BarRequest \
      --output-components BarOutput
      ```

  ~~~
  Would configure the output:
  ~~~~~

      ~~~
      `Hello World`
      ~~~~~

  ~~~
  To be served in response to requests to the following url relative to any
  domain the Foo App is built for:
  ~~~~~

      ~~~
      `index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer`
      ~~~~~

  ~~~
  And, in the context of this example, will result in creation of a Response
  configuration file at the following path:
  ~~~~~

      ~~~
      `/path/to/roady/Apps/Foo/Responses/BarResponse.php`
      ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Whose contents will be:
  ~~~~~

      ```
      <?php

      /** BarResponse.php */

      use roady\classes\component\OutputComponent;
      use roady\classes\component\DynamicOutputComponent;
      use roady\classes\component\Web\Routing\Request;

      $appComponentsFactory->buildResponse(
          'BarResponse',
          0,
          $appComponentsFactory->getComponentCrud()->readByNameAndType(
              'BarRequest',
              Request::class,
              $appComponentsFactory->getLocation(),
              'Requests'
          ),

          $appComponentsFactory->getComponentCrud()->readByNameAndType(
              'BarOutput',
              OutputComponent::class,
              $appComponentsFactory->getLocation(),
              'OutputComponents'
          ),

      );
      ```

  ~~~
  Note: The paths used in these examples are for example only.
  Make sure to adjust the paths used in these examples appropriately based on
  where roady and rig are actually installed.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Assuming the --path-to-apps-directory is assigned the path:
  ~~~~~

      ~~~
      `/path/to/roady/Apps`
      ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Then building the Foo App for the domain https://localhost:8080:
  ~~~~~

      ~~~
      `php /path/to/roady/Apps/Foo/Components.php 'http://localhost:8080'`
      ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Will make the output "Hello World" available in response to the following
  request to the domain http://localhost:8080:
  ~~~~~

      ~~~
      http://localhost:8080/index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer
      ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Note: Responses can be assigned any number of DynamicOutputComponents,
  OutputComponents, and Requests, as long as the respective Response,
  DynamicOutputComponents, OutputComponents, and Requests are all defined by
  the same App.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Hint: You can use rig --start-server to start a local development server to run
  your roady Apps locally. For more information about the --start-server flag
  use:
  ~~~~~

      ~~~
      `rig --help start-server`
      ~~~~~

  ### Flags:

  ~~~```--for-app```~~~~~    ~~~The name of the App to configure the Response for.~~~~~

               ~~~
               WARNING: The specified App must exist, if it does not, the new
               Response will not be configured.
               ~~~~~

  ~~~```--name```~~~~~       ~~~A name to assign to the new Response.~~~~~

               ~~~
               WARNING: The name must be unique, if a Response already
               exists with the same name the new Response will not be
               configured.
               ~~~~~

               ~~~
               WARNING: The specified name must be alphanumeric or rig will
               refuse to configure the Response.
               ~~~~~

               ~~~
               WARNING: If the specified name contains spaces, only the
               alphanumeric characters up to the first space will be used.
               ~~~~~

               ~~~
               For example:
               ~~~~~

                   ```
                   rig --new-response \
                   --for-app Foo \
                   --name 'Spaces In Alphanumeric Name'
                   ```

               ~~~
               Would result in the assigned name:
               ~~~~~

                   ~~~
                   `Spaces`
                   ~~~~~

  ~~~```[--position]```~~~~~ ~~~The position to assign to the Response. This position is used to
               sort the Response relative to other Responses and GlobalResponses
               that respond to the same Requests.~~~~~

               ~~~
               Defaults to: `0`
               ~~~~~

  ### Examples:

  ```
  rig --new-response --for-app Foo --name Bar
  ```
  ```
  rig --new-response --for-app Foo --name Baz --position 3.5
  ```
