  ```

  ### Description:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Configure a new Response for the specified App.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  A Response can be used to determine which OutputComponents, 
  and DynamicOutputComponents should have their output served 
  in response to a Request. 
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For example, the following will configure the output
  `Hello World` to be served in response to requests to 
  the relative url `index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --new-app \
  --name Foo

  rig --new-response \
  --for-app Foo \
  --name BarResponse

  rig --new-request \
  --for-app Foo \
  --name BarRequest \
  --relative-url 'index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer'

  rig --new-output-component \
  --for-app Foo \
  --name BarOutput \
  --output 'Hello World'

  rig --assign-to-response \
  --for-app Foo \
  --response BarResponse \
  --requests BarRequest \
  --output-components BarOutput
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  In this example, if the `Foo` App is built for the domain 
  `http://localhost:8080`, then the output "Hello World" will 
  be served in response to the following request to the domain 
  `http://localhost:8080`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080/index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Alternatively, if the `Foo` App is built for the domain 
  `https://roady.tech`, then the output "Hello World" will 
  be served in response to the following request to the domain 
  `https://roady.tech`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080/index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: A Response can be assigned multiple DynamicOutputComponents, 
  OutputComponents, and Requests, as long as the Response, the 
  DynamicOutputComponents, the OutputComponents, and the Requests 
  were all configured by the same App.

  ### Flags:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~```--for-app```~~~~~    
               ~~~
               The name of the App to configure the Response for.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               WARNING: The specified App must exist, if it 
               does not, the new Response will not be configured.
               ~~~~~
  ~~~```--name```~~~~~       
               ~~~
               A name to assign to the new Response.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               WARNING: The name must be unique, if a Response 
               already exists with the same name the new 
               Response will not be configured.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               WARNING: The specified name must be alphanumeric 
               or rig will refuse to configure the Response.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               WARNING: If the specified name contains spaces, 
               only the alphanumeric characters up to the first 
               space will be used. 
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               For example:
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               ```
               rig --new-response \
                   --for-app Foo \
                   --name 'Spaces In Alphanumeric Name'
               ```
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               Would result in the assigned name: `Spaces`
               ~~~~~
  ~~~```[--position]```~~~~~ 
               ~~~
               The position to assign to the Response. This 
               position is used to sort the Response relative 
               to other Responses and GlobalResponses that 
               respond to the same Requests. 
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               Defaults to: `0`
               ~~~~~

  ### Examples:
  ~~~~~

  ```
  rig --new-response --for-app Foo --name Bar

  rig --new-response --for-app Foo --name Baz --position 3.5
  ```
