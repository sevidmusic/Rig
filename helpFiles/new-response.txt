  rig --new-response --for-app --name [--position]

  Description:

  Configure a new Response for the specified App.

  Responses are used to serve output in response to appropriate requests to
  the domains that the App that defines the Responses is built for.

  For example, to create a new App named Foo, and configure the output:

      Hello World

  To be served in response to requests to any domain the Foo App
  is built for that correspond to the relative url:

      index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer

  You could make the following calls to rig:

      rig --new-app \
      --name Foo

      rig --new-request \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name BarRequest \
      --relative-url 'index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer'

      rig --new-output-component \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name BarOutput \
      --output 'Hello World'

      rig --new-response \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name BarResponse

      rig --assign-to-response \
      --for-app Foo \
      --response BarResponse \
      --requests BarRequest \
      --output-components BarOutput

  The combination of these calls to rig would result in the following Response
  configuration file:

      <?php

      /** BarResponse.php */

      use roady\classes\component\OutputComponent;
      use roady\classes\component\DynamicOutputComponent;
      use roady\classes\component\Web\Routing\Request;

      $appComponentsFactory->buildResponse(
          'BarResponse',
          0,
          $appComponentsFactory->getComponentCrud()->readByNameAndType(
              'BarRequest',
              Request::class,
              $appComponentsFactory->getLocation(),
              'Requests'
          ),

          $appComponentsFactory->getComponentCrud()->readByNameAndType(
              'BarOutput',
              OutputComponent::class,
              $appComponentsFactory->getLocation(),
              'OutputComponents'
          ),

      );

  Which, in the context of this example, would be located at the following path:

      /path/to/roady/Apps/Foo/Responses/BarResponse.php

  Note: The paths used in these examples will differ from the actual paths.
  Make sure to adjust the paths used in the examples appropriately based on where
  Roady and rig are actually installed.

  Assuming rig is installed in Roady's vendor directory at:

      /path/to/roady/vendor/darling/rig

  And assuming the --path-to-apps-directory is assigned the path:

      /path/to/roady/Apps

  Then building the Foo App for the domain https://localhost:8080:

      php /path/to/roady/Apps/Foo/Components.php 'http://localhost:8080'

  Will make the output "Hello World" available at the following request:
  to the domain http://localhost:8080:

      http://localhost:8080/index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer

  Hint: For local development you can use rig --start-server to start a local
  development server to run your Roady Apps locally.

  Flags:

  --for-app    The name of the App to configure the Response for.

               WARNING: The specified App must exist, if it does not, the new
               Response will not be configured.

  --name       A name to assign to the new Response.

               WARNING: The name must be unique, if a Response already
               exists with the same name the new Response will not be
               configured.

               WARNING: The specified name must be alphanumeric or rig will
               refuse to configure the Response.

               WARNING: If the specified name contains spaces, only the
               alphanumeric characters up to the first space will be used.

               For example:

                   rig --new-response \
                   --for-app Foo \
                   --name 'Spaces In Alphanumeric Name'

               Would result in the assigned name:

                   Spaces

  [--position] The position to assign to the Response. This position is used to
               sort the Response relative to other Responses and GlobalResponses
               that respond to the same Requests.

               Defaults to: 0

  Examples:

  rig --new-response --for-app Foo --name Bar

  rig --new-response --for-app Foo --name Baz --position 3.5
