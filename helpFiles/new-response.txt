  ```
  rig --new-response --for-app --name [--position]
  ```

  ### Description:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Configure a new Response for the specified App.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  A Response can be used to determine which OutputComponents,
  and DynamicOutputComponents should have their output served
  in response to a Request.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  For example, the following calls to rig will configure the output
  `Hello World` to be served in response to requests to the relative
  url `index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --new-app \
  --name Foo

  rig --new-response \
  --for-app Foo \
  --name BarResponse

  rig --new-request \
  --for-app Foo \
  --name BarRequest \
  --relative-url 'index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer'

  rig --new-output-component \
  --for-app Foo \
  --name BarOutput \
  --output 'Hello World'

  rig --assign-to-response \
  --for-app Foo \
  --response BarResponse \
  --requests BarRequest \
  --output-components BarOutput
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  In this example, if the `Foo` App is built for the domain
  `http://localhost:8080`, then the output "Hello World" will
  be served in response to the following request to the domain
  `http://localhost:8080`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  http://localhost:8080/index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Alternatively, if the `Foo` App is built for the domain
  `https://roady.tech`, then the output "Hello World" will
  be served in response to the following request to the domain
  `https://roady.tech`:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  https://roady.tech/index.php?foo=bar&baz=bazzer
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: Apps are built by executing the relevant App's 
  `Components.php` file via `php`. For example:
  ~~~
  ```
  php /path/to/roady/Apps/Foo/Components.php 'http://localhost:8080'
  ```
  ~~~~~
  More information about building Apps can be obtained via:
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --help Components.php
  ```
  ~~~~~
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  Note: A Response can be assigned multiple OutputComponents,
  DynamicOutputComponents, and Requests, as long as the Response,
  the OutputComponents, the DynamicOutputComponents, and the
  Requests were all configured by the same App.
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### Flags:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### `--for-app`
  ~~~~~
               ~~~
               The name of the App to configure the new Response for.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               WARNING: The specified App must exist at the
               path that corresponds to the path assigned to the
               `--path-to-apps-directory` flag. If the App does
               not exist, the new Response will not be configured.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               Note: It is unnecessary to specify
               the `--path-to-apps-directory` flag's
               value, rig will determine an appropriate
               path at runtime as long as the
               `--path-to-apps-directory` flag is
               not specified.
               ~~~
               Note: It is best to let rig determine the value
               of the `--path-to-apps-directory` flag to insure
               an appropriate path is used.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               Note: More information about the
               `--path-to-apps-directory` flag can
               be obtained via:
               ~~~
               ```
               rig --help path-to-apps-directory
               ```
               ~~~~~
               ~~~~~
               ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### `--name`
  ~~~~~
               ~~~
               An alphanumeric name to assign to the new Response.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               WARNING: The name must be unique. rig will refuse to
               configure the new Response if a Response with the same
               name already exists.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               WARNING: rig will refuse to configure the new Response
               if the name is not alphanumeric.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               Note: If the name contains spaces, and is not quoted,
               only the alphanumeric characters up to the first space
               will be used. For example:
               ~~~
               ```
               rig --new-response \
                   --for-app Foo \
                   --name Spaces In Name
               ```
               ~~~~~
               Would result in the assigned name: `Spaces`
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               Note: If the name contains spaces, and is surrounded
               by quotes, then rig will refuse to configure the new
               Response. For example, the following will fail:
               ~~~
               ```
               rig --new-response \
                   --for-app Foo \
                   --name 'Spaces In Quoted Name'
               ```
               ~~~~~
               ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### `[--position]`
  ~~~~~
               ~~~
               The position to assign to the Response. This
               position is used to sort the Response relative
               to other Responses and GlobalResponses that
               respond to the same Requests.
               ~~~~~
               ~~~
               Defaults to: `0`
               ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ### Examples:
  ~~~~~
  ~~~
  ```
  rig --new-response \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name FooBarBaz

  rig --new-response \
      --for-app Foo \
      --name BarBazFoo \
      --position 3.5
  ```
