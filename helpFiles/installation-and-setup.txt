Installation & Setup

        1. Move into the directory where you wish to install roady and rig.

           Note that the user's home directory is used in this example, make sure to adjust
           paths if necessary:

               cd ~/

        2. Clone roady from https://github.com/sevidmusic/roady.git:

               git clone https://github.com/sevidmusic/roady.git

        3. Move into roady's directory:

               cd ~/roady

        4. Update composer, this will install rig in ./vendor/darling/rig:

               composer update

        5. Add rig to your path:

               export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/roady/vendor/darling/rig/bin"

        6. Make sure rig is working:

               rig --help | more
