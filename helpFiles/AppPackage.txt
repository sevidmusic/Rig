  ### App Packages

  ~~~
  roady Apps can be shared easily in the form of App Packages. You can create a
  new App Package with `rig --new-app-package`.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  App Packages can be made into roady Apps with `rig --make-app-package`.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  To convert an existing App into an App Package you will need the AppPackager
  App.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  If you have already installed roady, the AppPackager's App Package will have
  been installed as part of the roadyAppPackages library when `composer update`
  was run.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Note: For help installing roady and rig, use:
  ~~~~~

    ~~~
    `rig --help getting-started`
    ~~~~~
  ~~~
  The AppPackager's App Package will be located at the following path
  relative to roady's root directory:
  ~~~~~

      ~~~
      `./vendor/darling/roady-app-packages/AppPackager`
      ~~~~~

  ~~~
  To make the AppPackager App, move into roady's root directory and run:
  ~~~~~

    ~~~
    `rig --make-app-package --path ./vendor/darling/roady-app-packages/AppPackager`
    ~~~~~

  ~~~
  To use the AppPackager App, you will need to build it for a domain. In this
  example the AppPackager will be built for the local domain
  http://localhost:8080, though it could be built for another domain.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  To build the AppPackager App move into roadys root directory and run the
  following:
  ~~~~~

    ~~~
    `php ./Apps/AppPackager/Components.php 'http://localhost:8080'`
    ~~~~~

  ~~~
  The next step is to build the App you want to package for the same domain.
  ~~~~~

    ~~~
    `php ./Apps/APPTOPACKAGE/Components.php 'http://localhost:8080'`
    ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Finally, if one is not already running, start a development server
  at `localhost` on port `8080`
  ~~~~~

    ~~~
    `rig --start-server --port 8080`
    ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Next, open a web browser and navigate to the following url:
  ~~~~~

    ~~~
    http://localhost:8080/index.php?page=AppPackager
    ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Using the provided select form, select the App you wish to package
  and click submit.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  The new App Package will be located in the AppPackager App's
  `resources/AppPackages` directory which will be located at the
  following path relative to roady's root directory:
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  `./Apps/AppPackager/resources/AppPackages/`
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  This App Package can be easily shared, and used to rebuild the original
  app on any roady installation.
  ~~~~~

  ~~~
  Note: The functionality of the AppPackager App is going to be incorprated into
  rig in the future so that the AppPackager App is not needed to package Apps.

  will be added to this documenation as soon as it is complete.
