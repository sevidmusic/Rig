ddms --new-app --name [--domain]

Description:

Creates a new Darling Data Management System App. The new App will be created at
the path that corresponds to the value assigned to the --ddms-apps-directory-path
flag.

For example, if --ddms-apps-directory-path is assigned the path:

    /path/to/DarlingDataManagementSystem/Apps

Then ddms --new-app --name Foo would create the Foo
App in:

    /path/to/DarlingDataManagementSystem/Apps/Foo


Note: You do not need to explicitly set the --ddms-apps-directory-path unless you
      intend to use an alternative Apps directory. --ddms-apps-directory-path's
      assigned value will be determined by ddms at runtime unless it is set
      explicitly.


Flags:

--name                       The name to assign to the new App

                             WARNING: The name must be unique, if an
                             App with the same name already exists the
                             new App will not be created.

[--domain]                   A domain to assign as the new App's default domain.
                             The default domain is used when an App's
                             Components.php is executed without specifying a
                             domain.

                             For example, executing:

                                 php Apps/Foo/Components.php

                             Would build the Foo App for the App's assigned
                             default domain.

                             If not specified, default domain will be:

                               http://localhost:8080

                             WARNING: Do not include the trailing / at the end
                             of the domain or you may run into issues.

Examples:

ddms --new-app --name "Foo"

ddms --new-app --name "Foo" --domain "http://localhost:8765"
