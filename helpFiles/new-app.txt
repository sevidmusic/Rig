```rig --new-app --name [--domain] ```

### Description:

~~~
Creates a new roady App. The new App will be created at
the path that corresponds to the value assigned to the
`--path-to-apps-directory` flag.
~~~~~

~~~
For example, if the `--path-to-apps-directory` flag is assigned the path:
~~~~~

~~~
    `/path/to/roady/Apps`
~~~~~

~~~
Then:
~~~~~

~~~
    `rig --new-app --name Foo`
~~~~~

~~~
Would create the new Foo App at:
~~~~~

~~~
    `/path/to/roady/Apps/Foo`
~~~~~

~~~
Note: You do not need to explicitly set the `--path-to-apps-directory` unless you
intend to use an alternative Apps directory. The `--path-to-apps-directory` flag's
value will be determined by rig at runtime unless it is set explicitly.
~~~~~

~~~
WARNING: Unless you really need to, it is best to let rig manage the
`--path-to-apps-directory` flag's value to insure an appropriate path is used.
~~~~~

~~~
For more information about the `--path-to-apps-directory` flag use:
~~~~~

~~~
    `rig --help path-to-apps-directory`
~~~~~

### Flags:

~~~```--name```~~~~~                       ~~~The name to assign to the new App~~~~~

                             ~~~WARNING: The name must be unique, if an
                             App with the same name already exists the
                             new App will not be created.~~~~~

~~~```[--domain]```~~~~~                   ~~~A domain to assign as the new App's default domain.
                             The default domain is used when an App is built
                             without specifying a domain.~~~~~

                             ~~~
                             For example:
                             ~~~~~
                             ~~~
                                 `php Apps/Foo/Components.php`
                             ~~~~~

                             ~~~
                             Would build the Foo App for the App's assigned
                             default domain.
                             ~~~~~

                             ~~~
                             If a --domain is not specified, the default
                             domain will be:
                             ~~~~~
                             ~~~
                               `http://localhost:8080`
                             ~~~~~
                             ~~~
                             The App's default domain will be defined in the
                             App's Components.php, and can be changed later
                             if necessary by editing the App's Components.php.

                             of the domain or you may run into issues. This is
                             a bug, and it is being addressed. See issue #193:
